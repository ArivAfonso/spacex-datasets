This provided good test data, even though the booster started rolling as it neared the ocean, leading to the shutdown of the central engine as the roll depleted it of fuel, resulting in a hard impact with the ocean. This was the first known attempt of a rocket engine being lit to perform a supersonic retro propulsion, and allowed SpaceX to enter a public-private partnership with NASA and its Mars entry, descent, and landing technologies research projects.

Final burn to heliocentric Earth-Mars orbit was performed after the second stage and payload cruised for 6 hours through the Van Allen radiation belts. Later, Elon Musk tweeted that the third burn was successful, and JPL Horizons On-Line Ephemeris System showed the second stage and payload in an orbit with an aphelion of 1.67 AU.

Its launch mass was 585 kg (1,290 lb) including fuel. After separating into a supersynchronous transfer orbit with an apogee of 69,400 km (43,100 mi), Beresheet raised its orbit by its own power over two months and flew to the Moon.

Despite the successful landing, due to rough seas and the fact that the Octagrabber had not been configured to grab the central core of a Falcon Heavy, the central core was unable to be secured to the deck for recovery and later tipped overboard in transit. SpaceX has since developed new attachment fixtures for the Octagrabber so this problem won't happen again. SpaceX recovered the fairing from this launch and later reused it in the November 2019 Starlink launch. Arabsat-6A, a 6,465 kg (14,253 lb) Saudi satellite, is the most advanced commercial communications satellite so far built by Lockheed Martin.

Third flight of Falcon Heavy. The side boosters from the Arabsat-6A mission just 2.5 months before were reused on this flight and successfully returned to LZ-1 and LZ-2. The center core, in use for the first time, underwent the most energetic reentry attempted by SpaceX, and attempted a landing over 1,200 km (750 mi) downrange, 30% further than any previous landing.

At 15,600 kg (34,400 lb), it is the heaviest payload so far launched by SpaceX, breaking the record set by the Starlink v0.9 flight earlier that year. This flight marked the first time that a Falcon 9 booster made a fourth flight and landing. This was also the first time that a Falcon 9 re-used fairings (from ArabSat-6A in April 2019). It was planned to recover the fairings with both Ms. Tree and Ms. Chief but the plan was abandoned due to rough seas."

The satellite will deliver the highest power density of any commercial satellite on-orbit, generate more than 20 kW of power, and have a large unfoldable antenna reflector, which enables broadcast to radios without the need for large dish-type antennas on the ground. Due to the heavy weight, the payload was injected into a sub-synchronous orbit of 224 km × 19,411 km (139 mi × 12,061 mi) and the satellite itself will transfer to full GTO. It was the first time a commercial primary payload flew on a booster which had been flown more than 4 times before. First dedicated customer launch where the fairings were previously used."

Also carried were the RamSat cubesat as payload for ELaNa 36, the SOAR cubesat for the University of Manchester and the first Mauritian satellite MIR-SAT1 to be launched from the station later. This was the last mission the Of Course I Still Love You droneship supported on the east coast, since SpaceX plans to launch Starlink satellites from the West Coast starting in July, which will require a droneship landing.
